# Configuring VPN

There are two possibilities to configure VPN connections that are provided by defguard server:

### Automatic with defguard client

Using defguard desktop client will:

* **automatically configures all VPN locations** available for the user - VPN Locations have access control based on groups - depending on which groups user is a part of **those VPN locations** will automatically appear after configuration
* &#x20;automatically add the client (device) to the user profile

Please go [to this documentation describing this process](add-new-instance/):[ **Adding instance to defguard client**](add-new-instance/)

### Manual - for other clients

By adding a device in the user profile there is a possibilty to use **other WireGuard clients** (like mobile clients - since defguard - for now - only has desktop clients available).

In order to configure/add your devlice manulally [go to this documentation section: **Adding a device manually**.](adding-wireguard-devices/)
