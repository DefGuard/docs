# Sending support information

In **Settings > Support** tab you'll be able to generate and send support data that can be used when debugging your issues.

To download configuration and logs use appropriate buttons. You can attach them to bug report in our GitHub repository.

The "Send email" button is active only if you [configured the SMTP server](setting-up-smtp-for-email-notifications.md).
