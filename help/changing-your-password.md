# Password change / Reset

## Resetting your password

If you don't have access to defguard you can reset your password with a link that will be sent to you on your email. Can be done in two ways:

#### Enrollment public page

The same url you have used to do your remote enrollment & onboarding has the functionality of password reset:

{% endhint %}

#### By admin

Ask your administrator to send you the password reset link.&#x20;
