# Enrollment

Desktop client also can enroll new users for an even more automated process that doesn't require them to set up their VPN manually.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This approach is only recommended when your Defguard instance has at least one location added. Otherwise, we advise you to use the [proxy ](https://github.com/DefGuard/proxy)frontend for enrolling new users.
{% endhint %}

For enrolling though the client user just needs to enter the enrollment token in [add-new-instance](configuring-vpn/add-new-instance/ "mention") process.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can learn more about enrollment in [remote-user-enrollment](../features/remote-user-enrollment/ "mention").
