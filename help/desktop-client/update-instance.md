# Update instance

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are looking for how to generate tokens for your users as an Administrator, look here:

[remote-desktop-activation.md](remote-desktop-activation.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Why do instances need updates?

Desktop stores all information locally and doesn't communicate with Defguard outside of the registration process. This means that information about instances are snapshots of the moment you registered them in the desktop client and you might want to update that, for example when some new locations are added or removed.

## How to update

Open defguard instance that you want to update, and click the "Edit Instance" button in the top right corner.

Now you need to ask your administrator to make you a new token.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only tokens issued from that specific instance will work in that modal.
{% endhint %}

After receiving the token and entering it into the form, click "Update Instance" and the modal should close.  Now your local configuration for that instance is up to date.
