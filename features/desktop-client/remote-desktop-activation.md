# Remote desktop activation

This process enables system administrators to manually create and distribute desktop activation tokens to users facing access issues to the Defguard instance.

Navigate to the user's list page.

Select "Remote desktop activation" from the action menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
This option is only available if the instance has at least one localization, and the user is 'active'. For users that require enrollment, you can choose the option 'Start enrollment' and that token will also work with the client.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You will be presented with a choice to send an activation token via email or you can choose to just display the token and deliver it through other methods.

After receiving the token, the user will need to follow the activation process in the client. You can find out more about it in [add-new-instance.md](add-new-instance.md "mention").
