description: How to update already registered instance.

# Update instance

Desktop stores all information locally and doesn't communicate with Defguard outside of the registration process. This means that information about instances are snapshots of the moment you registered them in the desktop client and you might want to update that, for example when some new locations are added or removed.



To update information about existing instances, just repeat the registration process via "Add Instnace" button and if that instance is already registered you won't need to create new device for your client but information about locations and their configurations should be automatically updated.
