# User onboarding after enrollment

After the [enrollment](./) process is done, you can easily share with new users **any relevant company information, links to company systems, security guidelines**, etc. In the [enrollment module](./#enrollment-settings), you can write **custom messages** using [markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/) that will be shown on the last step of the enrollment process and/or sent to the user via email:

What is unique about this process, is that you can also use [custom template tags ](./#enrollment-settings)that contain newly created user data, the admin (that has invoked the remote enrollment) data and others.
