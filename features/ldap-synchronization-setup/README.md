# LDAP synchronization

Defguard can be configured to apply all user changes to an LDAP instance.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The integration between Defguard and LDAP is designed to reflect changes made within Defguard in LDAP. However, changes made directly in LDAP will **NOT** be automatically imported into Defguard.
{% endhint %}

You can find out how to set up an LDAP connection with the Defguard instance [here](configuration.md).
