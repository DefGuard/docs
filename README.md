* WebAuthn/FIDO2 - for hardware key authentication support
* Web3 - authentication with software and hardware crypto wallets using Metamask and Wallet Connect

## VPN management

Defguard allows you to set up a Wireguard VPN server in a few simple steps. After that, you can monitor your network by seeing overall usage and per-user stats with information about all of their devices and download configuration files for new devices.

## Webhooks

## OpenLDAP synchronization

In a few simple steps you can synchronize your OpenLDAP server and get following features:

* Read existing users
* Create new users
* Modify existing users
* Remove users
* Manage groups

## Web3

Web3 - integration with Web3/blockchain functionalities. Since defguard secures the whole user journey/connection, from secure communication using VPN, then authentication based on company identity and Multi-Factor Authentication (supporting crypto wallets), itâ€™s a perfect web2 -> web3 gateway for your organization.

* Wallet management - with Metamask and Wallet Connect - an easy way for users to validate the ownership of wallets - no need to send wallet addresses through slack/email anymore
* Organizational self-custody wallets (in development) - create a self-custody, multi-sig Company wallet
* Blockchain transactions for organizations (in development) - since company members can securely connect/expose their wallets and the organization has a self-custody multi-signature wallet, the next step is to enable transactions on blockchain
* Blockchain node management (in development) - connect, monitor and manage your own blockchain nodes
