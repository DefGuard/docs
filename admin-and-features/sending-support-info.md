# Sending support information

If you need our help please join our Support Channel on Matrix: [https://matrix.to/#/#defguard:teonite.com](https://matrix.to/#/#defguard:teonite.com)

In addition you can send us **anonymous** support data by:

1. In **Settings > Support** tab you'll be able to generate and send support data that can be used when debugging your issues.
2. To download configuration and logs use appropriate buttons. You can attach them to bug report in our GitHub repository or send them in Matrix.
3. The "Send email" button is active only if you [configured the SMTP server](../help/setting-up-smtp-for-email-notifications.md).
