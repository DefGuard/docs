#### ⛑️ Want to help? ⛑️

Here is a [dedicated view for **good first bugs**](https://github.com/orgs/DefGuard/projects/5/views/5)

All source code of our app is located in three repositories

* [Core:](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard) backend and server for our app
* [Gateway:](https://github.com/DefGuard/gateway) VPN client which connects core with wireguard interface

You can find how to setup your development environment in [the Environment setup article](dev-env-setup.md).

We have a dedicated (closed only for developers) Matrix channel. If you publish a pull request and it will be accepted you will be invited to the developer's channel. For now, you can join our [General discussion](https://matrix.to/?ref=teonite.com#/#defguard:teonite.com).

### Found a bug?

If you found a bug you [can submit it here](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=bug\&template=bug\_report.md\&title=).

### Pull requests

All pull requests should be done against the master branch of any repository from above.

A good pull request should have:

* Description of changes made
